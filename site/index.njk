        DOTS, short for Decentralization Off The Shelf, is a design project supporting practitioners in decentralization with interface, content, and service design. Our main resource is a library of tried-and-tested design patterns, along with a glossary of terms and a research report detailing the needs and gaps we see in this space.
      </p>

      <p>
        DOTS is hosted by Simply Secure, a US-based nonprofit supporting the usability of safety and privacy tools. It aligns with Simply Secure's overall mission of creating open design resources for the community. We are actively seeking funding for the development of further resources. You can support us by <a href="/support-us">backing DOTS</a>.

        We are looking for partners and collaborators to workshop user experience and architecture patterns. By addressing the specific needs and challenges of your project, we can also learn valuable lessons that would apply to the community as a whole. The design work we do will feed into the production of our pattern library.
