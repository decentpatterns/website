Every piece of software needs some degree of interface, content, and service design. This is no different in decentralization. What is different, however, is that decentralized design introduces concepts and scenarios that diverge from today’s dominant, centralized paradigms. These differences have the potential to make incorporating and solving decentralized design problems more challenging for experienced and novice developers alike. That’s why in an effort to help us all better understand how to build decentralized applications, we’ve created the design patterns in this library to be generalizable to protocols, applications, and the user interfaces of decentralized applications. The patterns themselves have been divided below into categories to further increase accessibility and comprehension.
