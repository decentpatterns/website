# Vision & Mission

Our mission is to develop UX components and tools that developers and designers can use to build better user-facing applications backed by decentralized architectures. We do this by producing a library of resources, assets, and design patterns with the help and input of the larger community.

Our pattern library is inspired by the renowned architect and design theorist Alexander Christopher, author of “A Pattern Language”. Much like the way Christopher developed his patterns, our design patterns follow a structural template for clarity and convenience. Each pattern addresses a recurring design problem which we have observed and discovered in our hands-on research work, then comes the design solution to that problem. In addition, we also include examples, best practices, potential problems when using each pattern in real-life development work, take-aways and learning resources. Ultimately, our design pattern library aims to serve not only as the general repeatable solutions but also a reminder of what design is capable of.

## Why decentralization?

Decentralization allows the coexistence of different opinions and voices in a world of asymmetric power relations. Decentralized technologies, in particular, enable alternative applications that challenge the traditional models: where government and corporate control are causing harm, decentralized technologies have the potential to bring about autonomy, resilience, and equity.

## Why Design?

We believe that a human-centered design approach to decentralized technologies will ensure accessibility and usability for a better world where technologies bring about positive change to humans and their environments.

One of the main challenges for decentralized technologies is the lack of adaptation. There are far too many unfamiliar and technical concepts which often lead to confusion. Design allows for the simplification of these terms and helps make sense of things in a user-friendly manner. By combining a variety of design research methodologies and design principles, including iterative testing and feedback, we are able to obtain an understanding of users, their existing social practices, habits, and mental models. In any given step, user’ perspectives are always prioritized and emphasized. This empowers new ideas and allows us to compile best practices for decentralization design.

## Why collaborative?

The cornerstone of Decentralization Off The Shelf lies in collaboration. Our vision for a co-design process is driven by our experience in coaching and working alongside more than 60 open-source projects for the past five years. We learnt that for ever-evolving technologies to stay relevant, it takes a lot of iterations and inputs from designers and developers alike. Going forward, we hope to build a common space for all those who are fascinated by the possibility of decentralized technologies to come together and co-create.
