# Vision & Mission

Decentralized technologies enable alternative applications that challenge the traditional models: where government and corporate control are causing harm, decentralized technologies have the potential to bring about autonomy, resilience, and equity.

However, there is a significant gap between the protocols that define the decentralization space and the applications that users want to adopt. One of the missing aspects is UX design and testing that could bring decentralized protocols and applications to the next level of adoption.

Our mission is to develop UX components and tools that developers and designers can use to build better user-facing applications backed by decentralized architectures. We do this by producing a library of resources, assets, and design patterns with the help and input of the larger community.

## Why Design?

Designers aren't people with special powers to intuit what users want and need. If anything, designers know that they don't know what users want and need, and will go out to investigate. This is how we approach design in decentralization: through a series of hands-on research and testing, we have compiled ideas and best practices for decentralization design.
