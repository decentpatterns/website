# Invitation

## Join our virtual design workshop this spring!

This spring, we invite you to collaborate with other designers experienced in decentralized technologies.

This time, we will have a smaller group (maximum 8) designers. We will focus on
how identity (me/us) works in decentralized contexts, and how we can envision
a new way to relate to each other and ourselves in these new digital spaces.

If you are interested in attending, please send an email to
[mailto:team@decentpatterns.xyz](team@decentpatterns.xyz) with your name, email address, and how you found out
about this workshop.

Feel free to prepare to share any work in progress or old designs that never made it to the implementation phase.

### Topics we will cover

<div class="aside">

- Onboarding
  - What are the largest pain points for your users?
  - What are the problems for onboarding to decentralized identity tech?
  - What are the primary trust issues and how is that reflected in our messaging?
- Agency & identity
  - Who else knows who I am? Can I be anonymous?
  - What happens when I lose my password?
  - Can I use multiple devices? Can I share a device with others?
- Security & authentication
  - Who can see what, and for how long?
  - Why can't certain data be deleted?
  - What happens if a device is lost?
  - Who can I call if I run into a problem?
