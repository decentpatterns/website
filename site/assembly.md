## What to expect

Our Assemblies are hour-long, participatory events where we set the agenda depending on the people in the room. Our focus will be on design aspects in decentralization, but we explicitly welcome non-designers and non-developers to join the conversation as well!

- Hello & welcome!
- Agenda hacking
- Presentation and/or breakout sessions
- Last 10 min: new pattern requests & proposals

We will be hosting the event on [Discord](https://discord.gg/4uDSbWNPec), a platform that allows community members to communicate over chat, voice, and video. We also use [Miro](https://miro.com/) for collaborative whiteboarding.
