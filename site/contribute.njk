          <p class="mb-6">DOTS is a collective initiative working to identify needs, synthesize priorities, provide resources, and coordinate efforts to further the development and deployment of decentralized technologies. By addressing common obstacles to effective decentralization design, use, and adoption, we can increase the overall quantity and quality of decentralized applications. Given the size and importance of this project, we are actively seeking funding to help fuel the development of high-quality resources on a fast and efficient time frame.
