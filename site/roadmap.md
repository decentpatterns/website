# Roadmap

DOTS is a collective initiative to identify needs, synthesize priorities,
provide resources, and coordinate efforts to further the development and
deployment of decentralized technologies. By addressing these issues, we can
increase the overall quantity and quality of decentralized applications. We are
actively [seeking funding](/support-us) to fuel the development of high-quality
resources on a faster timeframe.

You can support us by <a href="/support-us">backing DOTS</a>.
