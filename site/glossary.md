Decentralization introduces a wealth of new concepts, many of which are named and described in different ways across many projects. This causes confusion among early adopters as well as barriers in onboarding new users. We've attempted to capture many of decentralization concepts in this glossary. If you see a term missing or incorrect, please propose a change.
