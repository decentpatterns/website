        DOTS, short for Decentralization Off The Shelf, is a design project supporting practitioners in decentralization through interface, content, and service design. Our main resource is a library of tried-and-tested <a href="/library">design patterns</a>, along with a glossary of terms and a <a href="/report">research report</a> detailing the needs and gaps we see in the current ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        DOTS is hosted by <a href="https://simplysecure.org/">Simply Secure</a>, a US-based 501(c)3 nonprofit supporting the usability of safety and privacy tools. We are actively seeking funding to assist in the development of additional critical resources in the decentralization space.

    <h3>Our Vision</h3>

      <p>
        Our mission is to develop UX components and tools that developers and designers can use to build better user-facing applications backed by decentralized architectures. To achieve this goal, the DOTS team – with the input and assistance of the larger community – is working to create a library of decentralization resources, assets, and design patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our <a href="/library">pattern library</a> is inspired by the architect and design theorist Christopher Alexander, co-author of “A Pattern Language.” Much like the way Alexander developed his patterns, our design patterns follow a structural template for clarity and convenience. Each pattern provides a design solution to a recurring design problem which we have observed and discovered in our hands-on research work. The library also includes examples, best practices, learning resources, and potential problems that may be encountered when using a given pattern in real-life development work. Ultimately, our design pattern library seeks to provide a roadmap to repeatable solutions and serve as a reminder of the countless capabilities of design.
