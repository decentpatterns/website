      <p>
        Decentralized technologies enable alternative applications that challenge the traditional models: where government and corporate control are causing harm, decentralized technologies have the potential to bring about autonomy, resilience, and equity.
      </p>

      <p class="xl:mb-6">
        However, there is a significant gap between the protocols that define the decentralization space and the applications that users want to adopt. Through a series of interviews and focus groups with technology designers and builders, we have identified 7 areas where projects can improve their own practice; where targeted research is necessary; and where funders can enable collaborative innovations.
      </p>

      <p class="xl:mt-12">
        One of the missing aspects are tools that developers and designers can use to understand how to build applications. We are now producing a library of resources, assets, and patterns to support the design and development of better user-facing applications that are backed by decentralized architecture.
